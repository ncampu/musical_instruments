Filtering through thousands of customer reviews can be a very long and arduous task for anyone, but is very important for the future of your product and ultimately your business. What if we you were able to categorize reviews so that you can immediately know if the customer has left a postive, neutral, or negative review? Utilizing my knowledge of Python and a Kaggle dataset, I apply machine learning models and figure out the most accurate machine learning algorithm to categorize musical instrument reviews left by customers.
